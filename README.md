# Music Tech Journey

> From Berklee College of Music to the intersection of AI, Mathematics, and Music.

This repository serves as a public journal of my learning path towards mastering the technical foundations of music technology and AI, with the goal of pursuing a master's degree at MIT.

## Learning Roadmap

### Mathematics
- [ ] **Linear Algebra**: Gilbert Strang's MIT OCW Course
- [ ] **Calculus**: Gilbert Strang's MIT OCW Course  

### Computer Science
- [ ] **Python Programming**
- [ ] **Signal Processing**
- [ ] **Machine Learning for Music**

### Projects
- [ ] **Chord Matrix Analysis**: Representing and transforming chords using linear algebra.

## Weekly Logs

### Week 1 (2025-10-31 to 2025-11-6)
**Focus**: Building the foundational mindset.
- **Linear Algebra**: Completed Lecture 1 & 2. Understood the geometric interpretation of systems of equations and matrix elimination.
- **Calculus**: Revisited the concept of derivatives as a rate of change.
- **Programming**: Set up Python environment and created the first `matrix_and_chord.py` script.
- **Music Practice**: Transcribe "I'm getting sentimental over you" and "Just Friends" at lease 1 solo with left hand comp.

## Current Goals
1. Complete the first 4 weeks of Strang's Linear Algebra course.
2. Build a simple Python script that can analyze the tempo of a music audio file.
3. Go to Jam session every month to have fun.
4. Compose everything.
